/**
 * A Parser converts character input into a Java object.
 *
 * <p>Semantically, this interface might have been more accurately named
 * <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshalling_(computer_science)">Unmarshaller</a> because it technically
 * converts a content stream into a Java object. However, the {@code Parser} name was chosen for consistency with the
 * {@link io.jsonwebtoken.JwtParser JwtParser} concept (which is a 'real' parser that scans text for tokens).  This
 * helps avoid confusion when trying to find similar concepts in the JJWT API by using the same taxonomy, for
 * example:</p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link io.jsonwebtoken.Jwts#parser() Jwts.parser()}</li>
 *     <li>{@link io.jsonwebtoken.security.Jwks#parser() Jwks.parser()}</li>
 *     <li>{@link io.jsonwebtoken.security.Jwks#setParser() Jwks.setParser()}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @param <T> the instance type created after parsing/unmarshalling
 * @since JJWT_RELEASE_VERSION
