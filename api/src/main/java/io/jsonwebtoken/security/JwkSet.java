/**
 * A JWK Set is an immutable JSON Object that represents a Set of {@link Jwk}s as defined by
 * <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7517.html#section-5">RFC 7517 JWK Set Format</a>. Per that specification,
 * any number of name/value pairs may be present in a {@code JwkSet}, but only a non-empty {@link #getKeys() keys}
 * set <em>MUST</em> be present.
 *
 * <p><b>Immutability</b></p>
 *
 * <p>JWK Sets are immutable and cannot be changed after they are created.  {@code JwkSet} extends the
 * {@link Map} interface purely out of convenience: to allow easy marshalling to JSON as well as name/value
 * pair access and key/value iteration, and other conveniences provided by the Map interface.  Attempting to call any of
 * the {@link Map} interface's mutation methods however (such as {@link Map#put(Object, Object) put},
 * {@link Map#remove(Object) remove}, {@link Map#clear() clear}, etc) will throw an
 * {@link UnsupportedOperationException}.</p>
