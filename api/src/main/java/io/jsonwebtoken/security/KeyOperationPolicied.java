     * because of the potential vulnerabilities associated with using the
     * same key with multiple algorithms.  Thus, the combinations "{@link Jwks.OP#SIGN sign}"
     * with "{@link Jwks.OP#VERIFY verify}", "{@link Jwks.OP#ENCRYPT encrypt}" with "{@link Jwks.OP#DECRYPT decrypt}", and "{@link Jwks.OP#WRAP_KEY wrapKey}" with
     * "{@link Jwks.OP#UNWRAP_KEY unwrapKey}" are permitted, but other combinations SHOULD NOT be used.</pre></blockquote>

     *

     * one can be created by using the {@link Jwks.OP#policy()} builder, or by implementing the
     * {@link KeyOperationPolicy} interface directly.</p>
