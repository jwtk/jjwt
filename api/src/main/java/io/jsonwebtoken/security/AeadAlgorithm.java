/**
 * A cryptographic algorithm that performs
 * <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authenticated_encryption">Authenticated encryption with additional data</a>.
 * Per <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7516.html#section-4.1.2">JWE RFC 7516, Section 4.1.2</a>, all JWEs
 * <em>MUST</em> use an AEAD algorithm to encrypt or decrypt the JWE payload/content.  Consequently, all
 * <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7518.html#section-5.1">JWA &quot;enc&quot; algorithms</a> are AEAD
 * algorithms, and they are accessible as concrete instances via {@link Jwts.ENC}.
 *
 * <p><b>&quot;enc&quot; identifier</b></p>
 *
 * <p>{@code AeadAlgorithm} extends {@code Identifiable}: the value returned from {@link Identifiable#getId() getId()}
 * will be used as the JWE &quot;enc&quot; protected header value.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Key Strength</b></p>
 *
 * <p>Encryption strength is in part attributed to how difficult it is to discover the encryption key.  As such,
 * cryptographic algorithms often require keys of a minimum length to ensure the keys are difficult to discover
 * and the algorithm's security properties are maintained.</p>
 *
 * <p>The {@code AeadAlgorithm} interface extends the {@link KeyLengthSupplier} interface to represent the length
 * in bits a key must have to be used with its implementation.  If you do not want to worry about lengths and
 * parameters of keys required for an algorithm, it is often easier to automatically generate a key that adheres
 * to the algorithms requirements, as discussed below.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Key Generation</b></p>
 *
 * <p>{@code AeadAlgorithm} extends {@link KeyBuilderSupplier} to enable {@link SecretKey} generation. Each AEAD
 * algorithm instance will return a {@link KeyBuilder} that ensures any created keys will have a sufficient length
 * and algorithm parameters required by that algorithm.  For example:</p>
 *
 * <pre><code>
 *     SecretKey key = aeadAlgorithm.keyBuilder().build();
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * <p>The resulting {@code key} is guaranteed to have the correct algorithm parameters and strength/length necessary for
 * that exact {@code aeadAlgorithm} instance.</p>
